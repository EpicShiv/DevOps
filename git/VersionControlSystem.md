# Version Control System

## What is version control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.

In a Distributed Version Control Systems DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients donâ€™t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history.

Version Control is a component of "Sofware configuration management (SCM)".
