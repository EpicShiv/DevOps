# .gitignore file

It is a text file that tells git which files or folders to ignore in a project.

A local .gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of a project.

You can also create a global .gitignore file and any entries in that file will be ignored in all of your git repositories.

The ignred files are can't be pushed th the remote repository.

Files can be ignored by entering file names in the .gitignre file or if all the file formats are same then you can use the wild card along with the format type.
